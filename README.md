# ðŸ“Š C++ Machine Learning Library

A machine learning library implemented from scratch in **modern C++**, focusing on clarity, performance, and modularity. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of core machine learning algorithms and advanced C++ programming, with no third-party dependencies.

## âœ¨ Current Capabilities

- **Linear Regression** â€” implemented from scratch using matrix algebra

## ðŸ”­ Upcoming Implementations

-  Multiple Linear Regression
-  Logistic Regression
-  K-Means Clustering

## ðŸš€ Planned Enhancements

To further showcase advanced machine learning and C++ design skills, future work may include:

- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Gradient Descent Optimizer Module
- Basic Feedforward Neural Network
