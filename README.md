# C++ Machine Learning Library

This project is a machine learning library implemented from scratch in modern C++, with a focus on clarity, modularity, and performance. It demonstrates core machine learning algorithms and matrix operations without relying on external ML frameworks.

## Features

- Linear Regression (Normal Equation)
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression (Batch Gradient Descent)
- Unit testing with Google Test (via NuGet)
- Modular architecture for future model extensions
